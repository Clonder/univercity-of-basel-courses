# Data part


The tasks was to extend code within template. This implementation is courtesy of the [Databases and Information Systems Group (DBIS)](https://dbis.dmi.unibas.ch ) at the University of Basel.

## Ex.1
The goal of the exercise is to implement a Chord-based lookup algorithm.

While this implementation is tailored for educational usage, it provides the full solution (for the moment).


It was needed to complete the implementation of the ChordPeer class and implement data storage and lookup for the Chord network.

## Ex.2
Extend the AbstractOracleXaBank and OracleXaBank classes in order to facilitate a
money transfer between two banks.
